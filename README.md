A community driven project to replace Tapatalk with an alternative, stable, free, and open-source solution.

Tapatalk was a way to view internet forums in a convenient manner on any Android or iOS mobile device. For the past 7 or so years, Tapatalk has slowly become a husk of its former self. Polls are still not available for iOS, people are getting ads on their forums when they paid the monthly fee for no ads, and push notifications haven't worked in years. They raised their monthly subscription costs and the service is still not stable or reliable.

My goal is to build a replacement to Tapatalk that is free and open source. Obviously, this is a large undertaking; and seeing as I'm still new to PHP, I'm hoping to over a long period build something simple that "just works".

Currently, I will only be supporting PHPBB and Android at the moment until the project gets underway and gains traction. I'll preface this by saying that this will be a slow process, and will likely take years.
